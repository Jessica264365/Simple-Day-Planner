## About the Project

This is a simple day planner for anyone who works a 9am to 5pm job and wants to stay organized. When the page is loaded the current date and time is displayed on the top. The user can enter any information they wish to store on the time block of their choosing. When the save button is clicked the information they entered is stored in local storage. If the user leaves the page the information will still be there. The time blocks change color depending on the hour. Past hours will be grey. The current hour will be pink and the future hours will be green. Overall this is a great simple application for anyone looking to organize their work day.
